### Lovely Morning, My name is Victoria Rubio 💫
- 🫀 I'm a service oriented developer
- 👩🏻‍💻 I'm currently refining my full stack projects and researching docker
- ☁️ My goal is to obtain an AWS Certification within the next year
- 🤖 I'm super excited about the newest waves of software innovation that has been demonstrated at the CES convention in Las Vegas this year

I sparked my passion for programming while in my Full Stack Web Development class that I was taking concurrently with my Capstone. That realization that I could help the nonprofit organizations that I so dearly love **turned me into an engine**. I started using the MERN stack on my passion project of a **digital footprint manager** with my market audience of older adults set on my mind. I witnessed first hand how aliented they were from the rest of modern society out of fear of their digital security. I wanted to create a web app that was user friendly and would **help them manage their accounts and passwords with easy access to data breach breakdowns and a database of contact information from top companies to prevent phishing.**

It has been such a joy contributing through these projects. I am looking forward to taking care of the company I work for and the projects we design for our community. 
Thank you for getting to know a snippet of my heart and passion in programming. 
If you're interested in making a difference and want to partner up, feel free to reach out to me. 

Warmest of Regards, 

Victoria R.
